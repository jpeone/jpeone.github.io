I'm an aspiring data engineer based out of Seattle, currently working in logistics and supply chain. I'm particularly interested in data infrastructure in more manual industries like manufacturing and shipping. A natural builder and doer, I'm driven to learn new skills needed to establish a foundation for projects in their initial stages. I enjoy cycling, weight lifting, board games, and music.
